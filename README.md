# GetsSchooled

GetsSchooled is an android platform that enables students and tutors to connect,
we help student to find the right tutors for them and help tutors to promote themselves.
After quick sign-up , a user can log-in as tutor and start promoting himself (add a profile photo, price, and courses).
Or a user can log-in as a student and start searching for a tutor in a certain field.
A student can filter the tutors by courses, by default we promote our best rated tutors.
We Also show for each tutor the distance from the student location to the teachers learning area.
